	<p> Hello there. My name is Smavehyia. I am an undergraduate Engineering student, attempting to solve big problems in the world through the help of technology and ideation. My interest lies in full-stack development as well as UX/UI design. In other words, I like to code things that have a purpose, from scratch, and make them look nice.

			<h5> Safety KeyChain </h5>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-body">
			<p> In my first year design group, we implemented this safety keychain. This project was designed for upper year university students to use when they face dangerous situations. It has four main functions, a flashlight for better visibility, a sound alarm to alert others, a "send-a-text" feature to selected contacts and a 911 help button. A wireframe of the complimentary app which allows users to set up contacts and customized text message,  was also designed by us. This project exercised many components of the design cycle as well as use of SolidWorks, Arduino and Proto.io.  </p>

			<h5> Puzzle Box </h5>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-body">
			<p> As a group, we designed a puzzle box using SolidWorks and 3D-printing. Puzzle boxes are essentially a series of simple puzzle steps that allow the user to open the box. We decided on creating a puzzle box with our program name. So the lid of the box has a track and letters hook on that track in different ways. Essentially, the "S" holds the box closed by sliding in the lid. Next slides in the Y, then D. E hooks on the knob in the corner. The user has to first twist off the E, slide the D vertically, slide the Y horizontally over and vertically out and finally slide the S off to open the box. </p>
				<p>My focus was to design six pieces in such a way that the user would find it intuitive but also be challenged. Each group member then went on their own to create their piece. I worked on the "S" which was the final connecting piece between the box. It was challenging because it had connections with other many different pieces. I used SolidWorks to model the system to see its interaction and would make improvements in an iterative manner.</p>

            <p> This app is simply to create awareness among users about how much positivity or negativity they are radiating through their tweets. In a social media driven world, it is essential to recognize that the words spread through the web can impact our personality in a very powerful way. This app will help users realize if they tweet negative stuff unconsciously so that they can then take steps to improve themselves in that regard. </p>
			<p>
				In order to create this app, node.js was used for the backend while React framework was utilized for the front end.

			<h5> Aut2Learn </h5>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-body">
			<p> This project was created in a hackathon, Equithon 2018 which had a theme of equity. This app was created to accelerate learning for individuals with Autism and provide them with the support they need to be able to reach their maximum potential. </p>
			<p> Initially, this project required alot of user research about Autism and treatments that are in current use. ABA or Applied Behavioural Analysis therapy consistently showed up as an effective treatment for Autism. Essentially, this approach focuses on teaching motor, behavioural and everyday skills. It values positive reinforcement and can also be conducted by anyone easily. Thus, this was the approach taken for this app. </p>
			<p> The app essentially has two main pathways, one for the student and one for the parent/therapist. However, both accounts are under the login of the guardian. After logging in as the student, several different activities appear on the screen. These range from everyday task activities and situational games. The user engages in the app by picking the category, completing the activity and achieving points which show up in their profile. They also have a scoreboard where they can unlock trophies after certain point accumulations. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In the parents side of the app, their home screen opens to a progress tracker of the student where they can see how many activities the student has completed and how well they are engaged. They have a profile tab where they can change their password, email and account information. The final important part of the parents side of the app is the community tab. In this, the parent can connect with other guardians going through the same journey. This is also a connection for the parent to professionals and experts in the Autism and therapy domain. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In terms of developement, the app was initially prototyped in Proto.io and then coded in Android Studio using Java. However, the functionality of this app is so widespread that it is currently under further developement to improve that aspect.

			<h5> ReadyKit </h5>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-body">
            <p>ReadyKit is geared towards preparing individuals for natural disasters that may strike. With a clean interface, the user is able to easily maneuver through the web app to learn about disaster, customize prep lists and add contacts, all in one location!</p>
			<p>
                    With the world constantly changing through global warming and other natural phenomenons, we need a platform to allow individuals to prepare for any kind of natural disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Undoubtedly, we still see posters about hurricane preparedness and other emergencies but with technology being widely used in the world, these fail to be as effective as they once might have been.
            </p>
            <p>
                    That is where our solution comes in to play. This web app takes the technological aspect into account when informing the public about the importance of preparing for natural disasters. Whether it be an adult or a young child, any individual can access this platform to learn about the different disasters in an easy-to-understand manner, see the suggested check-list for preparations and then customize it to their own needs! User can make a profile, keep track of their checklists and add in emergency contacts, keeping all important information in one location. Being a web-app, it is easily accessible to anyone in the world, thus informing the public globally about preparing for natural emergencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                    One of the strongest points of this application is the clean interface it offers. Usually, informational websites and content tend to less visually appealing but this app is quite the opposite. Even while spreading information about something that is very serious, it does not scare or bore the user. Colors make the app pop out and are a visual treat for users of all ages, from children to adults. Thus, this app ensure that the content is delivered to the user. The interactive aspect lets the user not only learn about such emergencies but also get involved in making their own checklists and exploring a serious topic in greater depth.
